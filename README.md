Attendance System Proposal
Overview

The proposed system is a QR Code-based attendance management solution designed to streamline the attendance process in educational institutions. It aims to digitize attendance records for colleges, reducing the need for physical registers and saving time.
Functionality
User Authentication

    Login Credentials: Both teachers and students will have individual logins authenticated by their Registration Number and a self-set password.
    Scheduled Classes: Upon login, teachers can view their scheduled classes.

Attendance Marking

    Teacher's Interface: Teachers can initiate attendance sessions for their classes, generating a unique QR code displayed on their device.
    Student Attendance: Students can mark their presence by scanning the QR code using the system's app. The QR code updates after each scan to prevent fraudulent attendance.

    Data Privacy: Only teachers have access to attendance records, ensuring confidentiality.

Moderator Role

    Delegation: Teachers can assign moderator privileges to students to take attendance in their absence or assistance.

Enhancement Opportunities

    Facial Recognition: Integration of facial recognition technology for enhanced security and authentication.
    Security Measures: Continuous improvement of security protocols to safeguard against unauthorized access and system breaches.

Technologies Implemented

    QR Code Generation and Scanning: Utilization of QR code technology for marking attendance.
    Backend Data Management: Storing attendance records in an Excel format.
    User Authentication: Registration Number and password-based login system.
