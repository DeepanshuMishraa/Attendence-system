Attendance System Proposal
Overview

Our proposed system is a QR Code-based attendance management solution designed specifically for educational institutions. Its primary goal is to digitize attendance records in colleges, eliminating the need for physical registers and optimizing time management.
Functionality
User Authentication

    Login Credentials: Both teachers and students will possess individual logins authenticated by their Registration Number and self-set passwords.
    Scheduled Classes: Upon login, teachers gain access to their scheduled classes.

Attendance Marking

    Teacher's Interface: Teachers can seamlessly initiate attendance sessions for their classes, generating unique QR codes displayed on their devices.
    Student Attendance: Students mark their presence by scanning the QR code via the system's app. The QR code dynamically updates after each scan to prevent any fraudulent attendance attempts.

Data Management

    Attendance Records: All attendance data is systematically stored in an Excel sheet, accessible for download or review by authorized teachers.
    Data Privacy: Only teachers hold access rights to attendance records, ensuring utmost confidentiality.

Moderator Role

    Delegation: Teachers have the authority to assign moderator privileges to students, allowing them to manage attendance in their absence or provide assistance.

Enhancement Opportunities

    Facial Recognition: Integrating advanced facial recognition technology for heightened security and authentication.
    Security Measures: Commitment to continuously improving security protocols, safeguarding against unauthorized access and potential system breaches.

Technologies Implemented

    QR Code Generation and Scanning: Utilizing QR code technology for efficient attendance marking.
    Backend Data Management: Employing an Excel-based storage system for attendance records.
    User Authentication: Registration Number and password-based login system for seamless access.

Future Developments

    Ongoing Improvements: Continual updates and enhancements based on user feedback and technological advancements.
    Feature Integration: Introducing additional features to augment user experience and fortify security measures.
